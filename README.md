Silence Remover for Video/Audio Files
A Python script that uses FFmpeg to automatically detect and remove silent portions from video or audio files. The tool trims both audio and video streams, ensuring synchronization, and outputs a clean, seamless file without silent gaps.

Features:
Silence Detection: Detects silent segments based on customizable dB threshold and minimum duration.

Precise Trimming: Removes silence while maintaining audio-video synchronization.

Customizable Parameters: Adjust silence threshold (-dB) and minimum silence duration.

Efficient Encoding: Outputs video in H.264 and audio in AAC format for high-quality results.

Cross-Platform: Works on any system with FFmpeg installed.

Use Cases:
Remove awkward pauses or silence from recorded videos.

Clean up podcasts or voiceovers by eliminating background noise gaps.

Optimize video content for social media or presentations.

Requirements:
Python 3.x

FFmpeg (must be installed and accessible in the system PATH)

How It Works:
Detects silent portions using FFmpeg's silencedetect filter.

Splits the video/audio into non-silent segments.

Reconstructs the file by concatenating the non-silent parts.

Outputs a clean, trimmed file without silent gaps.

Installation:
